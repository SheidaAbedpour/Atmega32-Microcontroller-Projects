# Traffic Light Controller 
This project implements a traffic light control system using an AVR microcontroller. The system manages traffic lights for both main and subordinate roads, allowing for adjustable green, yellow, and red light durations based on ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) inputs.



Setting registers is a fundamental aspect of programming microcontrollers, as these registers control the various functions and peripherals of the microcontroller. In this project, several registers are configured to manage the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), timers, and GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) ports.
